# to run

"bs" stands for "build scripts" üòò

## loonix üêß
install make, cmake, sdl3, pkg-config and OpenGL ES 3 drivers from your package manager.
```
./bs/linux_install.sh
./bs/linux_build.sh
```

## MackOhEss üçé
`brew install sdl3 pkg-config`

This will try to copy ANGLE's libGLESv2.dylib out of your Google Chrome install.

More details, scripts, and examples [here](https://github.com/erik-larsen/gles-for-mac).

If you don't have one, you should clone and build ANGLE (TODO: automate this as part of the build script; there are example commands in the link above)

```
./bs/macos_install.sh
./bs/macos_build.sh
```
Release build:
```
RELEASE=1 ./bs/macos_build.sh
```

## Windoze ü™ü
highly recommended debugger: [raddebugger](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/raddebugger/)

highly recommended profiler: [superluminal](https://superluminal.eu/)

(call is not needed if using powershell)
```
call ./bs/win_install.bat
```

download ANGLE from [here](https://github.com/mmozeiko/build-angle/releases), rename it "angle" and drop it in `build/`

Example:
```
move "C:\Users\cedric\Downloads\angle-x64-2025-03-23\angle-x64" "build\angle"
```

Run install again; you should get a window now
```
call ./bs/win_install.bat
```

### Build and run

Henceforth you can simply call `win_build_run` to build and run:
```
call ./bs/win_build_run.bat
```

### Debugger

Or if you're using a debugger, you may prefer to simply `call win_build.bat`
```
call ./bs/win_build.bat
```

### Release

Release build, cmd.exe:
```
set RELEASE=1 && bs\win_build.bat
```

Release build, powershell:
```
$env:RELEASE="1"; .\bs\win_build.bat
```

# Updating the map

1. Open models/blend/map.blend in Blender 4.4.0

2. Duplicate the Map Collection

3. Hide the old Map Collection, select everything in the new one.

4. Join them all into one object

5. Name the object appropriately, e.g. IntroGravestoneTerrain

5. Select the resulting object and Export > Wavefront OBJ

6. Configure like so (It can help to create an Operator Preset with these options)

7. Save it to the `models/obj/` folder, not the `models/blend/` folder (which will be the default option)

9. Delete the duplicate Collection or exit without saving.

10. `cd` into `models/` and run `./build.sh` (Run the OBJ cooker)

11. Compile and run as usual
