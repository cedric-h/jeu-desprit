# to run

"bs" stands for "build scripts" üòò

## loonix üêß
install make, cmake, sdl3, pkg-config and OpenGL ES 3 drivers from your package manager.
```
./bs/linux_install.sh
./bs/linux_build.sh
```

## MackOhEss üçé
`brew install sdl3 pkg-config`

This will try to copy ANGLE's libGLESv2.dylib out of your Google Chrome install.

More details, scripts, and examples [here](https://github.com/erik-larsen/gles-for-mac).

If you don't have one, you should clone and build ANGLE (TODO: automate this as part of the build script; there are example commands in the link above)

```
./bs/macos_install.sh
./bs/macos_build.sh
```
Release build:
```
RELEASE=1 ./bs/macos_build.sh
```

## Windoze ü™ü
highly recommended debugger: [raddebugger](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/raddebugger/)

highly recommended profiler: [superluminal](https://superluminal.eu/)

(call is not needed if using powershell)
```
call ./bs/win_install.bat
```

download ANGLE from [here](https://github.com/mmozeiko/build-angle/releases), rename it "angle" and drop it in `build/`

Example:
```
move "C:\Users\cedric\Downloads\angle-x64-2025-03-23\angle-x64" "build\angle"
```

Run install again; you should get a window now
```
call ./bs/win_install.bat
```

### Build and run

Henceforth you can simply call `win_build_run` to build and run:
```
call ./bs/win_build_run.bat
```

### Debugger

Or if you're using a debugger, you may prefer to simply `call win_build.bat`
```
call ./bs/win_build.bat
```

### Release

Release build, cmd.exe:
```
set RELEASE=1 && bs\win_build.bat
```

Release build, powershell:
```
$env:RELEASE="1"; .\bs\win_build.bat
```

# Updating the map

## 1. Open models/blend/map.blend in Blender 4.4.0

## 2. Duplicate the Map Collection
<img width="229" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 9 11 03‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c753628c-f453-4691-94be-249d6f06cf4c" />

## 3. Hide the old Map Collection, select everything in the new one.

## 4. Join them all into one object
<img width="521" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 9 12 59‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd1e620b-1b8b-47ff-aedd-9398545b5da0" />

## 5. Name the object appropriately, e.g. IntroGravestoneTerrain

## 6. Select the resulting object and Export > Wavefront OBJ

## 7. Configure like so (It can help to create an Operator Preset with these options)
<img width="238" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 9 14 08‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44170dfc-21b9-441d-85ef-58ecb070cb4c" />

## 8. Save it to the `models/obj/` folder, not the `models/blend/` folder (which will be the default option)
<img width="569" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 9 14 44‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87c1a009-8af0-4678-a9d6-005e3cf71fe9" />

## 9. Delete the duplicate Collection or exit without saving.

## 10. `cd` into `models/` and run `./build.sh` (Run the OBJ cooker)
<img width="862" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-20 at 9 16 14‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ed81832-cb80-43cb-8571-83634a114dd3" />

## 11. Compile and run as usual


# Importing an Icon from https://tldraw.com

## 1. Open two tldraw windows, one with the content you want to export and one incognito tab
<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-24 at 6 54 02‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dab21543-8187-4993-9d7f-5edb6b5551ec" />

## 2. Copy the content you want to export into the incognito tab
<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-24 at 6 54 45‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c8d3349-70a4-4332-88e2-9ed9df44fb76" />

## 3. Export -> SVG

Make sure to save it in the repo's `svg/` directory in case we further automate this process in the future.

## 4. Drag and drop the SVG onto the [SVG cooker](https://cedric-h.github.io/linear-webgl/svg_cooker.html)
<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-24 at 6 57 03‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88345e64-d82b-4451-9ee9-84a194bfbeb8" />

## 5. Copy and paste the resulting code into a file in `svg/include/`
<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-24 at 7 01 53‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8372b6fb-962f-47cc-ba0a-c18de430cb20" />

## 6. Include the file in `src/geometry_assets.h`, and add a gl_Model enum variant for it.

## 7. Associate the enum variant with the file contents
